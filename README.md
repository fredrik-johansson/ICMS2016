#  ICMS 2016 Session: High-precision arithmetic, effective analysis and special functions

ICMS 2016: [Home](http://icms2016.zib.de/), [Sessions](http://icms2016.zib.de/sessions.html)

## Organizers

* Fredrik Johansson (INRIA Bordeaux) <fredrik.johansson@gmail.com>

## Aim and Scope

High-precision methods have become an important tool to get reliable results when solving numerical problems of increased size and complexity. The goal of this session is to present advances in software for high-precision or certified numerical methods, particularly in the context of effective complex analysis and computation of transcendental functions. Possible subjects include but are not limited to:

* Arbitrary-precision and mixed-precision arithmetic
* Interval arithmetic and Taylor methods
* High-precision or rigorous computation of D-finite functions, L-functions and modular forms
* Certified numerical integration and solution of ODEs
* Applications, for instance in number theory, combinatorics, and mathematical physics 

Work in these areas combining numerical methods with computer algebra is particularly welcome.

## Publications

A *short abstract* will appear on the permanent conference web page (see below) as soon as accepted.

An *extended abstract* will appear on the permanent conference web page (see below) as soon as accepted.
It will also appear on the proceedings that will be distributed during the meeting.

A ***journal special issue*** consisting of full papers will be organized immediately after the meeting. 

## Submission Guidelines

If you would like to give a talk at ICMS, you need to submit first a short abstract and then later an extended abstract. See the guideline for the details.

After the meeting, the submission guideline for a journal special issue will be communicated to you by the session organizers.
